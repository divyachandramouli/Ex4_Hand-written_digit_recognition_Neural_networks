# Ex4_Hand-written digit recognition using Neural Networks

This programming exercise was done as part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University), taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.

* Built a model to recognize handwritten digits using neural networks. 
* Implemented backpropagation to compute gradients for the parameters of the neural network, trained the neural network using Octave's fmincg optimization solver and used feedforward propagation to make predictions. 
* Computed training accuracy for the neural network, studied the effect of varying learning settings on the training accuracy
